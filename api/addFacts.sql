('Planets', 'Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, Venus has the highest atmospheric temperature due to its thick atmosphere which traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse effect – making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.'),
('Planets', 'Mars is known as the ‘red planet’ in our solar system due to the rocks contained within it being red, and when oxidised this turns them red.'),

('Stars', 'Most of the stars in our galaxy, including the sun, are categorized as main sequence stars. They exist in a stable state of nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen to helium and radiating x-rays. This process emits an enormous amount of energy, keeping the star hot and shining brightly.'),
('Stars', 'Some stars shine more brightly than others. Their brightness is a factor of how much energy they put out–known as luminosity–and how far away from Earth they are. Colour can also vary from star to star because their temperatures are not all the same. Hot stars appear white or blue, whereas cooler stars appear to have orange or red hues.'),
